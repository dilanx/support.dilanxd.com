# Get an Access Token

This process is largly structured based on the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) specification. There are some things missing but I hope to make it completely compliant in the future.

## 1. Get an authorization code

Once you have created an app, you'll need to **REDIRECT** them to the **authorization endpoint** to get an **authorization code**. The endpoint is called authenticate but ignore that lol it's for authenticating the user and also authorizing your app on their behalf. Keep in mind that this is `https://auth.dilanxd.com`.

<Endpoint
  method="GO TO"
  endpoint="/authenticate"
  servers={['https://auth.dilanxd.com']}
  query={[
    {
      id: 'client_id',
      description: 'Your 12-digit client ID.',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      id: 'redirect_uri',
      description:
        'A URL with an approved domain to redirect the user after authorization.',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      id: 'state',
      description:
        'A random string to prevent CSRF attacks. Ensure that you check this when the user is redirected back to your app.',
      required: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

You'll then be redirected back to your application at the endpoint you specified in the `redirect_uri` query parameter. This URL will contain a `state` query parameter, which you should verify, and a `code` query paramter, which you should **immediately** exchange for an access token since authorization codes expire quickly.

## 2. Exchange code for token

Once you've verified `state`, use the `code` to get an access token by making the following API request. Keep in mind that this is `https://api.dilanxd.com`.

<Endpoint
  method="POST"
  endpoint="/auth/token"
  servers={['https://api.dilanxd.com']}
  body={[
    {
      id: 'client_id',
      description: 'Your 12-digit client ID.',
      required: true,
    },
    {
      id: 'code',
      description: 'The authorization code.',
      required: true,
    },
  ]}
  contentType="application/json"
  responses={[
    {
      status: 200,
      description: 'Operation successful',
      params: [
        {
          id: 'access_token',
          description: 'The access token.',
          required: true,
          type: 'string',
        },
      ],
      contentType: 'application/json',
    },
    {
      status: 400,
      description: 'Invalid or missing parameters',
    },
  ]}
/>

## 3. Use the access token

Now, you can make requests to the API using the access token. Just pass it in the `Authorization` header as a bearer token when necessary.

```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```
