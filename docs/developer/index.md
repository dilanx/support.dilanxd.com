# Developer Guide

If you're looking to work with APIs of my apps and services, you can find relevant documentation in their knowledge base sections. However, if you're planning on integrating auth.dilanxd.com authentication into your app or need to get data from an account there, you'll need to set up a client here.

## Application Client

- [**Create** an application](./create-app.md)
- [**Get an access token** to perform actions as a user](./get-access-token.mdx)
