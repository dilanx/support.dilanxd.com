# Viewing the dining hall menus

You can view a live feed of today's dining hall menus in **#menu**.

Discord loads a lot faster than the Dine On Campus menus, so you might find this useful.

## Access the menus from your phone's home screen

Did you know you can create a shortcut to the menus right from your home screen? These instructions are for iOS using the official [**Shortcuts**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334) app.

First, download the [**NU Menus shortcut**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c97a79e4e85a4ff39f9f184b0b81538f) on your phone.

Then, in the Shortcuts app, tap on the NU Menus shortcut's **3 dots**, tap on the **NU Menus** name at the top, then tap **Add to Home Screen**. Press **Add**, and you can now quickly jump to the menus on Discord! The Discord app must be installed for this to work.
