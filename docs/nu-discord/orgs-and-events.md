# Advertising Northwestern-related organizations and events

While general advertising is not allowed on the server, advertising Northwestern-specific organizations and events certainly is. We hope you'll use the large community on Discord to spread the word about your organization and its events.

Advertisement messages should only be sent in **#orgs-and-events**.

## Getting access

Only organization representatives or faculty/staff members can send messages in **#orgs-and-events**.

To request access, type **`/orgrequest`** in any channel you can chat in and select the Wildbot command from the list that appears (in most cases, type `/orgrequest` and press `Enter` and it'll automatically select the command). You'll be required to enter a message that describes your org or event and what you hope to share with the community. A server administrator will review your request as soon as possible and will let you know its status via direct message.

**Access only needs to be requested once.** Once you have access, you're free to post in the channel as much as you'd like, provided that it's not too spammy and that it's relevant to your organization or event.

## Sending messages

Once you have access, you can send messages in **#orgs-and-events**. However, you must follow these guidelines:

- **The message should be relevant to your organization or event.** Make sure that it's clear what organization your represent and what it is you're advertising.
- **The message should include all relevant details.** Make sure not to be too vague. You might have more action on your message if you include details in one place rather than having people have to visit other places or ask people for more information. However, don't make your message too long. Include all important details, but don't include unnecessary information. You can link to external websites or other resources for that.
- **Don't send multiple messages in immediate succession.** This is an announcement channel, not a chat channel. Don't send multiple messages in immediate succession. Instead, include all the information in a single message. Each separate message should be for a separate event.

## Creating events

Discord's **events** feature is open for use by org reps. [**Learn more about that here.**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409494125719-Scheduled-Events#docs-internal-guid-2f29ff97-7fff-1aeb-a5a9-a92834c856df)

Do not tamper with other events that do not belong to you. Doing so can cause you to lose org rep status. Contact a server administrator if you have any questions.
