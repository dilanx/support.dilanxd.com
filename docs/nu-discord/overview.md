# An overview of the NU Discord

The Northwestern University Discord server is a large community on Discord where thousands of current students, alumni, applicants, faculty, and staff can get together to chat, ask questions, socialize, and more. The server is student-run and is not officially affiliated with Northwestern University.

[**Join the server here.**](https://discord.com/servers/northwestern-655629737888055317)

Once you join, you'll see a bunch of channels for different purposes. Before checking those out, however, you should verify yourself.

## Completing verification

To ensure that the server is safe from spam and other malicious activity, we require that all users complete a verification process before they can chat and access the rest of the server. This way, you can be sure that everyone you're talking to is affiliated with Northwestern in some way.

Verification takes place in the **#welcome** channel. After reading the rules, press one of the buttons at the bottom of the channel to start the verification process.

### I'm a student or alumnus

If you're **a current student or an alumnus**, select this option. You'll be prompted to enter your [Northwestern-provided email address](https://services.northwestern.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=1498). This email address must use **@u.northwestern.edu**, **@alumn.northwestern.edu**, **@kellogg.northwestern.edu**, or **@law.northwestern.edu**. You'll also be prompted to enter your graduation year, which determines whether or not you're an alumnus or a current student.

Once you enter your information, you'll receive an email with a verification code. Enter this code in the prompted menu to complete verification.

Once verification is complete, you'll be able to send messages in main channels and access other student-only text and voice channels.

### I'm an applicant

If you're **an applicant or prospective student**, select this option. This does not require any verification but will only give you access to the **#applicants** forum channel. There, you can quickly get answers to questions about the school and the application process from current and past students, along with relevant faculty and staff. Access is limited to this channel to ensure that chatting members in other channels are affiliated with the university.

If you are accepted into Northwestern and choose to attend, you can select the **I'm a student or alumnus** option once you obtain your Northwestern email address to gain full access to the server.

### I'm faculty or staff

If you're **a faculty or staff member**, select this option. You'll be prompted to enter your Northwestern email address, which must use **@northwestern.edu**. Once submitted, a server administrator will review your request. Check your email for a message from **`discord@u.northwestern.edu`** with instructions to complete verification.

## Selecting roles

Once you've completed verification, you're good to go! However, you can customize your profile with other roles to get relevant notifications and show relevant information to other members.

Visit **#roles** to get started. There, react with the emojis corresponding to the roles you want to add. Selecting a college role will unlock a college-specific roles channel where you can select your major to display on your profile.

## About the featured channels

The **#questions** forum channel allows you to post a question and see responses in an organized manner. Start typing your question in the search bar to see if it's already been asked and any responses to it. If not, you can post your question. Questions and answers are fueled by the community, so helping out others is encouraged!

### #applicants

Applicants and prospective students can use the **#applicants** forum channel to ask questions related to the school and the application process. If you're currently affiliated with the university, help out applicants by answering their questions!

## Getting help

Server administrators and moderators are here to help! Feel free to message anyone with the **Administrator** or **Moderator** roles if you need help with anything at all.

If the issue is related to an ongoing conversation or messages in a channel, you can ping **`@Moderator`** in the chat.

You can also send an email to the official email address of the server, [**discord@u.northwestern.edu**](mailto:discord@u.northwestern.edu).
