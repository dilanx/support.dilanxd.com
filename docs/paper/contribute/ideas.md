# Paper Feature Ideas

Here, you can find a list of feature ideas submitted by users and developers. There may be other feature ideas that aren't listed here since features that are high priority for me to do myself won't be found here. Features that are lower priority or are open to contributions from other excited developers can be found here. Anyone interested in contributing to the project can use this list as inspiration for things to work on!

**Interested in adding to the list?** Submit a [Feature Request](https://forms.dilanxd.com/paper-support?t=Feature+Request)!

**Interested in contributing to Paper?** Check out the [Contributing to Paper](./index.md) guide to get started. Feel free to pick something from this list!

## List of Ideas

- [ ] Allow changing colors of built-in courses and sections
- [ ] Add a grouping feature to allow for things like a "main" category and a "backup" category to improve schedule organization
