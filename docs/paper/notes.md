# Notes

Sometimes, you need to attach some extra text to your plans and schedules. You can do that with **Notes**!

(haha no pun intended)

- Notes can only be added to plans and schedules that are linked to your account. Make sure to have one [activated](./getting-started-with-plans.md#creating-a-plan) (it won't let you write notes if you don't).
- Notes are **not** saved automatically. When there are unsaved changes, a green **Save** button will appear. Make sure to press it to save your notes!
- Notes are not included in the [shared plan link](./plans-share.md).

## Writing notes

Click on the **Notes** button in the toolbar at the top of the page. A note window will popup over your plan or schedule. Write notes as necessary and make sure to save. You can **drag** the note window around to move it anywhere on the page. Close the window by pressing the **x icon** at the top right of the little window or by pressing the **Notes** button again.
