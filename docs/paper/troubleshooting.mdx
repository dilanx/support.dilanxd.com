# Troubleshooting Paper

<ErrorBox />

## About errors

At the moment, there are no known errors. If you're here because of outdated or incorrect course data, see the [FAQ](./faq.md) instead.

An actual error on Paper is usually indicated by one of the following:

- A **popup** with a red exclamation triangle with the text "Well, this isn't good" beside it.
- A **loading indicator** that doesn't seem to end.
- Everything freezes or crashes.
- The site itself cannot be accessed.

## What to do

If you encounter an error, here are some things you can try:

- **Refresh the page.** It may be a one time thing.
- **Clear website data and cache for Paper.** You can look up how to do this for your browser.

If neither of those work, submit a **[support request](https://forms.dilanxd.com/paper-support?t=Technical+Issue+or+Bug)**.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but helping me fix the issue would be amazing!
